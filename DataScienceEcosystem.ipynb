Its extensive ecosystem of libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, makes it a powerful choice for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.\n","\n","2. **R**: R is another popular language for statistical analysis and data visualization. It provides a rich set of packages like ggplot2 and dplyr, which are favored by statisticians and data analysts.\n","\n","3. **SQL**: While not a general-purpose programming language, SQL (Structured Query Language) is essential for working with relational databases. Data scientists often use SQL to retrieve, filter, and manipulate data stored in databases.\n","\n","4. **Julia**: Julia is gaining traction as a high-performance language for scientific computing and data analysis. It's known for its speed and efficiency, making it suitable for computationally intensive tasks.\n","\n","5. **Scala**: Scala, often used with Apache Spark, offers a powerful combination for distributed data processing and machine learning. It provides a concise syntax and integrates well with Java libraries.\n","\n","These languages offer different strengths and capabilities, allowing data scientists to choose the best tool for a given task.\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Commonly Used Libraries in Data Science\n","\n","Some of the commonly used libraries by Data Scientists include:\n","\n","1. **Pandas**: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library for Python. It provides data structures and functions for efficiently cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data.\n","\n","2. **NumPy**: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a variety of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\n","\n","3. **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a widely used plotting library in Python. It allows Data Scientists to create a variety of static, animated, and interactive visualizations.\n","\n","4. **Seaborn**: Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a higher-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.\n","\n","5. **Scikit-learn**: Scikit-learn is a machine learning library in Python. It offers simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, and it's often used for classification, regression, and clustering tasks.\n","\n","\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Data Science Tools\n","\n","| Data Science Tools |\n","| ------------------ |\n","| Jupyter Notebook   |\n","| RStudio            |\n","| Visual Studio Code |\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["17"]},"execution_count":3,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers\n","result = (3 * 4) + 5\n","result\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["3.3333333333333335"]},"execution_count":4,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.\n","minutes = 200\n","hours = minutes / 60\n","hours\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# **Objectives:**\n","\n","In this notebook, we covered the following key objectives:\n","\n","- List popular languages for Data Science.\n","- Introduce commonly used libraries in Data Science.\n","- Provide examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.\n","- Demonstrate how to convert minutes to hours using Python.\n","\n","\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Author\n","\n","Diya\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.11"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
